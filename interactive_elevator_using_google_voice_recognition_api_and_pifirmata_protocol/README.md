# interactive_elevator_using_google_voice_recognition_api_and_pifirmata_protocol
This repository contains the code for my python project. In this project I developed an interactive elevator prototype using Google Voice Recognition api & PyFirmata Protocol. Integrated voice commands for floor selection and elevator actions, allowing for convenient and user-friendly operations. Implemented Arduino as the control unit, enabling real-time communication between the voice recognition system and physical elevator components.
